# Mechain Storage Provider

Mechain Storage Provider (abbreviated SP) is storage service infrastructure provider. It uses Mechain as the ledger and the single source of truth. Each SP can and will respond to users' requests to write (upload) and read (download) data, and serve as the gatekeeper for user rights and authentications.

## Disclaimer

**The software and related documentation are under active development, all subject to potential future change without notification and not ready for production use. The code and security audit have not been fully completed and not ready for any bug bounty. We advise you to be careful and experiment on the network at your own risk. Stay safe out there.**

## SP Core

SPs store the objects' real data, i.e. the payload data. Each SP runs its own object storage system. Similar to Amazon S3 and other object store systems, the objects stored on SPs are immutable. The users may delete and re-create the object (under the different ID, or under the same ID after certain publicly declared settings), but they cannot modify it.

SPs have to register themselves first by depositing on the Mechain blockchain as their "Service Stake". Mechain validators will go through a dedicated governance procedure to vote for the SPs of their election. SPs are encouraged to advertise their information and prove to the community their capability, as SPs have to provide a professional storage system with high-quality SLA.

SPs provide publicly accessible APIs for users to upload, download, and manage data. These APIs are very similar to Amazon S3 APIs so that existing developers may feel familiar enough to write code for it. Meanwhile, they provide each other REST APIs and form another white-listed P2P network to communicate with each other to ensure data availability and redundancy. There will also be a P2P-based upload/download network across SPs and user-end client software to facilitate easy connections and fast data download, which is similar to BitTorrent.

Among the multiple SPs that one object is stored on, one SP will be the "Primary SP", while the others are "Secondary SP".

When users want to write an object into Mechain, they or the client software they use must specify the primary SP. Primary SP should be used as the only SP to download the data. Users can change the primary SP for their objects later if they are not satisfied with its service.

## Quick Started

*Note*: Requires [Go 1.20+](https://go.dev/dl/)

## Compile SP

Compilation dependencies:

- [Golang](https://go.dev/dl): SP is written in Golang, you need to install it. Golang version requires `1.20+`.
- [Buf](https://buf.build/docs/installation/): A new way of working with Protocol Buffers. SP uses Buf to manage proto files.
- [protoc-gen-gocosmos](https://github.com/cosmos/gogoproto): Protocol Buffers for Go with Gadgets. SP uses this protobuf compiler to generate pb.go files.
- [mockgen](https://github.com/uber-go/mock): A mocking framework for the Go programming language that is used in unit test.
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/): Command-line JSON processor. Users should install jq according to your operating system.

```shell
# clone source code
git clone https://github.com/zkMeLabs/mechain-storage-provider.git

cd mechain-storage-provider

# install dependent tools: buf, protoc-gen-gocosmos and mockgen
make install-tools

# compile sp
make build

# move to build directory
cd build

# execute mechain-sp binary file
./mechain-sp version

### Note

If you've already executed `make install-tools` command in your shell, but you failed to make build and encountered one of the following error messages:

```shell
# error message 1
buf: command not found
# you can execute the following command, assumed that you installed golang in /usr/local/go/bin. Other OS are similar.
GO111MODULE=on GOBIN=/usr/local/go/bin go install github.com/bufbuild/buf/cmd/buf@v1.25.0

# error message 2
Failure: plugin gocosmos: could not find protoc plugin for name gocosmos - please make sure protoc-gen-gocosmos is installed and present on your $PATH
# you can execute the fowllowing command, assumed that you installed golang in /usr/local/go/bin. Other OS are similar.
GO111MODULE=on GOBIN=/usr/local/go/bin go install github.com/cosmos/gogoproto/protoc-gen-gocosmos@latest

# if you want to execute unit test of sp, you should execute the following command, assumed that you installed golang in /usr/local/go/bin. Other OS are similar.
GO111MODULE=on GOBIN=/usr/local/go/bin go install go.uber.org/mock/mockgen@latest
```

Above error messages are due to users don't set go env correctly. More info users can search `GOROOT`, `GOPATH` and `GOBIN`.

## SP Dependencies

If a user wants to start SP in local mode or testnet mode, you must prepare `SPDB`, `BSDB` and `PieceStore` dependencies.

### SPDB and BSDB

SP uses [SPDB](../modules/spdb.md) and [BSDB](../modules/bsdb.md) to store some metadata such as object info, object integrity hash, etc. These two DBs now use `RDBMS` to complete corresponding function.

Users now can use `MySQL` or `MariaDB` to store metadata.The following lists the supported RDBMS:

1. [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
2. [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)

More types of database such as `PostgreSQL` or NewSQL will be supported in the future.

### PieceStore

Mechain is a decentralized data storage system which uses object storage as the main data storage system. SP encapsulates data storage as [PieceStore](../modules/piece-store.md) which provides common interfaces to be compatible with multiple data storage systems. Therefore, if a user wants to join SP or test the function of SP, you must use a data storage system.

The following lists the supported data storage systems:

1. [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/): An object storage can be used in production environment.
2. [MinIO](https://min.io/): An object storage can be used in production environment which is compatible with AWS S3.
3. [POSIX Filesystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX): Local filesystem is used for experiencing the basic features of SP and understanding how SP works. The piece data created by SP cannot be got within the network and can only be used on a single machine.

### Install Dependencies

#### Install MySQL in CentOS

1. Install MySQL yum package

```shell
# 1. Download MySQL yum package
wget http://repo.mysql.com/mysql57-community-release-el7-10.noarch.rpm

# 2. Install MySQL source

# every line should represent one entry of gateway route. The comment after each line must contain which route name it represents.
# Most of APIs has a qps number, offered by QA team.  That usually means the max qps for the whole 4 gateway cluster.
# How to setup the RateLimit value, it is a sophistcated question and need take a lot of factors into account.
# 1. For most query-APIs, we can setup a rate limit up to the 1/4 of max qps, as the config is for only one gateway instance.
# 2. Also we avoid to setup a too large or too small rate limit value.
# 3. For upload/download APIs, it is diffiult to use a rate limit as a protect mechanism for the servers. Because the performance of upload/download interactions usually dependens on how large the file is processed.
# 4. We tetatively setup 50~75 as the rate limit for the download/upload APIs and we can ajdust them once we have a better experience.
# 5. The rate limt config will upgraded in next version to use http methods and virtual-host/path style as part of the matching keys.

## App info

These fields are optional and they can.

```
GRPCAddress = '0.0.0.0:9333'
```

## Database

To config `[SpDB]`, `[BsDB]`, you have to input the `user name`, `db password`,`db address`  and  `db name` in these fields.

## PieceStore

To config `[PieceStore]` and `[PieceStore.Store]`, you can read the details in this [doc](./piece-store.md)

## Chain info

- `ChainID` of testnet is `mechain_5151-1`.
- `ChainAddress` is RPC endpoint of testnet, you can find RPC info [here](../../../api/endpoints.md)

## SpAccount

These private keys are generated during wallet setup.

## Endpoint

`[Endpoint]` specified the URL of different services.

For single-machine host (not recommended):

```
[Endpoint]
ApproverEndpoint = ''
ManagerEndpoint = ''
DownloaderEndpoint = ''
ReceiverEndpoint = ''
MetadataEndpoint = ''
UploaderEndpoint = ''
P2PEndpoint = ''
SignerEndpoint = ''
AuthenticatorEndpoint = ''
```

For K8S cluster:

```
[Endpoint]
ApproverEndpoint = 'manager:9333'
ManagerEndpoint = 'manager:9333'
DownloaderEndpoint = 'downloader:9333'
ReceiverEndpoint = 'receiver:9333'
MetadataEndpoint = 'metadata:9333'
UploaderEndpoint = 'uploader:9333'
P2PEndpoint = 'p2p:9333'
SignerEndpoint = 'signer:9333'
AuthenticatorEndpoint = 'localhost:9333'
```

## P2P

- `P2PPrivateKey` and `node_id` is generated by `./mechain-sp p2p.create.key -n 1`

- `P2PAntAddress` is your load balance address. If you don't have a load balance address, you should have a public IP and use it in `P2PAddress`. It consists of `ip:port`.

- `P2PBootstrap` can be left empty.

## Gateway

```
[Gateway]
DomainName = 'region.sp-name.com'
```

The correct configuration should not include the protocol prefix `https://`.

## BlockSyncer

Here is block_syncer config.
The configuration of BsDBWriteAddress can be the same as the BSDB.Address module here. To enhance performance, you can set up the write database address here and the corresponding read database address in BSDB.

```
Modules = ['epoch','bucket','object','payment','group','permission','storage_provider','prefix_tree', 'virtual_group','sp_exit_events','object_id_map','general']
BsDBWriteAddress = 'localhost:3306'
Workers = 50
```
